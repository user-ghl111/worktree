User:
name: string, /^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]{1,64}$/ — the identity; requests authenticate with
a bearer token that resolves to this name (Authorization: Bearer / ?token=).
"local" is a reserved client-side-only name: its data never leaves the device.

Reminder:
id: string,
name: string | undefined,  // display name; absent for unnamed reminders
deadline: timestamp,
repeat: time | undefined,   // recurrence interval in ms; undefined = one-shot
active: boolean,            // false disables firing without deleting

Reminder notifications (server-side, Web Push):
- The server sweeps all users' trees every 30s (REMINDER_SWEEP_MS) and fires
  reminders whose latest occurrence T just became due: T = deadline for
  one-shot reminders; T = deadline + k*repeat (largest k with T <= now) for
  recurring ones. REMINDER_SWEEP_MS must be smaller than the 60s fire window
  (the server refuses to start otherwise — a larger interval lets occurrences
  fall between ticks and never fire).
- An occurrence fires only within a 60s window of becoming due
  (now - T < 60s). Occurrences that pass while nothing can deliver are
  skipped permanently — missed reminders are never backfilled.
- Inactive reminders (active: false) and reminders on completed nodes never
  fire.
- Delivery is out-of-band (browser push service), so the app does not need
  to be open. Occurrences are deduped server-side, so restarts cannot
  double-fire.

Node:
id: string,
name: string, (non-empty, must not contain '/')
weight: number,
children: Set[Node],
reminders: Reminder[],
status: boolean, (true for completed, false for uncompleted)
note: string, (detailed description; '' when unset)
createdAt: timestamp, (creation time in ms; 0 for nodes created by legacy ops)
deadline: timestamp | undefined, (task deadline; absent when none)
completedAt: timestamp, (completion time in ms; 0 while uncompleted or completed
by a legacy op — only meaningful when status is true)

Legacy default: ops persisted before these fields existed replay to
note: '', createdAt: 0, completedAt: 0, no deadline — fixed defaults keep replay
deterministic.

sibling order: uncompleted siblings first, then completed; within each group ascending
(weight, name). weight may collide; names are unique among siblings, so the order is
deterministic across replays. Status and rename ops re-sort the node's siblings.
User weights are "small weights" (e.g. 1, 2, 3): completion status, not weight,
decides which group a node lands in.
sibling names: unique within a parent — names are the path segments clients address nodes by.

Block:
id: string,
name: string, (non-empty)
start: timestamp, (period start, ms)
end: timestamp, (period end, ms; start < end)
note: string, (detailed description; '' when unset)
status: boolean, (true for completed, false for uncompleted)
nodeId: string | undefined, (linked worktree node; absent = standalone block)

At most one block may link a given node.

Blocks and linked nodes propagate completion in both directions. Propagation
is derived state inside a single apply — no extra history ops, so replay is
deterministic and undo/rewrite revert it automatically:
- completing/uncompleting a node completes/uncompletes its linked block
- completing/uncompleting a block completes/uncompletes its linked node
- a new or relinked block starts with its node's status
- only direct links propagate: completing a parent node does not touch the
  blocks of its descendants
Removing a node keeps its linked blocks but clears their nodeId; undoing the
removal restores the links via replay. copy/rename/move leave links intact.

Every operation (tree and calendar) carries an optional timestamp: the
client-generated creation time of the op in ms. Clients stamp Date.now() on
every op they issue; legacy ops predating the field replay without it.
Timestamps travel inside the op, so replay stays deterministic.

TreeOperation:
add(id, new_name, new_id, weight[, note, deadline, created_at][, timestamp]) | 
remove(id[, timestamp]) | 
rename(id, new_name[, timestamp]) | 
move(id, new_parent_id, new_weight[, timestamp]) | 
copy(id, new_parent_id, new_id, new_weight[, new_name][, timestamp]) | 
complete(id[, timestamp]) | 
uncomplete(id[, timestamp]) | 
add_reminder(id, rmd_id[, rmd_name], deadline, repeat[, timestamp]) | 
remove_reminder(rmd_id[, timestamp]) | 
edit_reminder(rmd_id, patch: {
  name?: string,
  deadline?: timestamp,
  repeat?: time | null,   // absent = unchanged; null = clear repeat
  active?: boolean,
}[, timestamp]) | 
edit_node(id, patch: {
  note?: string,
  deadline?: timestamp | null,   // absent = unchanged; null = clear the deadline
}[, timestamp])

add's note/deadline/created_at are optional: they default to '', unset and 0.
Clients no longer send created_at — replay derives it from the op timestamp
(created_at wins when both are present, for legacy reads). A complete op
records its timestamp as the node's completedAt; uncomplete clears it.
A node may only be completed once all of its children are completed (the
check applies to complete_block too, via the propagated node status).
The reverse is derived, inside a single apply and without recording a history
op: uncompleting a node — or introducing an uncompleted node under a completed
parent (add/move/copy) — uncompletes every completed ancestor in turn, so a
completed node never has an uncompleted child in the derived state.
An empty edit_node or edit_reminder patch (no fields at all) is rejected.

copy is shallow: copies name, status, reminders, note, deadline and completedAt,
not children. new_name defaults to the source's name. The copy's createdAt
comes from the copy op's timestamp (falling back to apply time for legacy ops),
so it is deterministic across replays.

CalendarOperation:
add_block(id, name, start, end[, note, node_id][, timestamp]) |
remove_block(id[, timestamp]) |   // idempotent: removing an unknown block is a no-op
edit_block(id, patch: {
  name?: string,
  start?: timestamp,
  end?: timestamp,    // merged start/end must satisfy start < end
  note?: string,
  nodeId?: string | null,   // absent = unchanged; null = clear the link
}[, timestamp]) |
complete_block(id[, timestamp]) |
uncomplete_block(id[, timestamp])

add_block/edit_block reject a node_id that is already linked by another block
(`node already linked to a block`) and a node_id that does not exist (`unknown
node id`). Empty edit_block patches are rejected. Completing/uncompleting an
unknown block is rejected (like complete).
A complete_block stamps the linked node's completedAt with the op timestamp
(via propagation); uncomplete_block clears it.

NodeFilter (client-side display criteria, not part of the persisted log):
keyword?: string,           // name OR note contains it (case-insensitive)
nameContains?: string,
noteContains?: string,
deadlineBefore?: timestamp, // inclusive; requires a deadline
hasDeadline?: boolean,
overdue?: boolean,          // deadline set, not completed, deadline < now
createdAfter?: timestamp,   // inclusive
createdBefore?: timestamp,  // inclusive
status?: boolean,           // true = only completed; false = only uncompleted

Filtering is a pure view concern: matchesFilter/filterTree in core compute it;
the frontends only render the result. The root never matches a filter.
